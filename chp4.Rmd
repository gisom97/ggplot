## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}

1 / 200 * 30

(59 + 73 + 2) / 3

sin(pi/2)
```

```{r}

x <- 3 * 4
```

```{r}

object_name <- value

object_name <- value
```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

this_is_a_really_long_name <- 3.5

```

```{r}

r_rocks <- 2 ^ 3
```

```{r}

```

```{r}

seq(1, 10)
```

```{r}

x <- "hello world"
```

```{r}

y <- seq(1, 10, length.out = 5)

y
```

4.4.1 There is an error because the first argument is not exactly the same as the second.  There is a dot missing on the second argument

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

filter(mpg, cyl == 8)
filter(diamonds, carat > 3)
```

```{R}
??menus
```

4.5.3 This allows you to see all of the shortcuts on R.  You can use ??menus or use a ? to help find shortcuts on R.
